    # Comparison (explanatory comment):
    # - Recursive DFS is concise and maps directly to the conceptual algorithm,
    #   but may hit Python's recursion depth limit on very deep graphs.
    # - Iterative DFS (with an explicit stack) avoids recursion limits and can be
    #   more efficient in languages/situations where function call overhead matters.
